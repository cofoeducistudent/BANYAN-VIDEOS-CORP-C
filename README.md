**Banyan-Videos-Corporation - project brief**.

Banyan videos corporation has asked for a website to help them retail their video merchandise online.For this reason, they have provided a brief stating what they would like to see on the site with features that they would wish on it.


* The front page should have a search facility allowing users to search for products

* It should have a carousel showing a selection of films.

* It should show news/information which banyan videos deem fit. This is not expected to be an RSS-feed or an integrated feed from other sites, but a section allowing banyan video administrators to post corporate messages and news.

* On the members-only section, there should be more article links to other important news on the web (curated by banyan videos admin). This should have a title/description, a picture, all linkable to the source material.

* The colour theme should be straightforward and simplistic, and the appearance of the site should be predominantly light and clean.


* Banyan Videos plan is to  centrally control and updated the film catalogue infrequently from a file from head-office created by authorized staff. Therefore, they wish to have a way of populating the product line very quickly. This will ensure prices and sale discounts are also effectively controlled. The intention is for head Office (H.O) to connect to the server via an administrator access, upload the data every so often. BVC do not use a CMS for creating film items(except in odd circumstances), as that will redact a central control model and lead to chaos and potential fraud.


* In the future, they wish to have a separate server to serve images for their products, which will have a commercial uniform asset look, like significant retailers such as Argos or Sainsbury's. However, the division that will handle that is not yet up and running. For this reason, they simply wish to use images that are readily available online showing the video covers. These images are owned by the movie production companies and placed in the public domain for promotion. Banyan videos corp will be purchasing their videos from their leading distributors, thus avoiding copyright infringement or legal entanglements.



* Videos film products should also be presented on the site within specific genre or classification for quick search if a customer does not know a particular title of a film but has an idea of the flavour of film they wish to purchase.


* Some Video films will be discounted to members automatically.

* For members, there should be a member's area, where banyan videos will post inside news and features, and watch trailers or any sneak peek teasers posted.

* Banyan videos say that they have a corporate head office (H.O) that will deal with all issues from customers, and therefore it is sufficient to have a contacts page that provides a contact form. 

* Finally, they wish the website to be up and running quickly & cheaply.

<hr>

[<< Back](#top)

**a. Strategy**
 
Following the project brief and further clarification, I have decided to approach that will facilitate banyan videos requirements in the following way.


* The site will be built using a framework for the benefit of speed. I will use the Django framework.

* The finished site will be hosted initially on the **HEROKU** platform. I expect the site will be migrated to Banyan Corporations own hosting service as a future date for performance reasons. 

* Although the Django framework defaults to an SQL-light database, I will utilize the POSTGRES SQL relational database management system (RMDBS) hosted on HEROKU.

* In addition using Django will allow me to create the database items in abstracted format (models), therefore if banyan Corporation choose to change databases in the future it will be reasonably easy to implement.

* I am not quite sure of the colour scheme to use yet, but will keep it plain and simple.

* For e-commerce and commerce aspects, I will employ the "Stripe-Payment" solution. The benefit of this is that the security will be inherently strengthened, as user payment credit card (CC)details will be handled entirely by the "STRIPE Corporation" and not reside within our website architecture. Although the Django framework defaults to an SQL-light database, I will utilize the POSTGRES SQL relational database management system (RMDBS) hosted on HEROKU.


* Banyan videos say that they have a corporate head office (H.O) that will deal with all issues from customers, and therefore it is sufficient to have a contacts page that provides a contact form. 

* I will use the username combined with the session ID to make transactions specific.

* **unsername:transacion**


* I will use an external email service provider **mailjet** to provide email functionality. Django email systems was configured to use this provider. The configurations settings were handled by using **environment variables**. The mailing system is common off the shelf (COTS). below is a diagrammatic representation.

* **The email is required to send:**
* 1 Receipt to Customer
* 2 Order to Banyan-Videos-Corp Sales Shipping Department
* 3 Contact message to Banyan-Videos-Cortp

**Potential Users**

I have identified some potential users of the site and have classified them as:-

|User Type|Ability|
|---------|-------|
|Owner|Banyan Videos Corp - Online Retailer of fine videos|
|Administrator - level|The administrator will be able create and post material to the site. In addition, there will also be able to populate the site with new products.|
|Customer(Registered) - level|Registered users will have access to browse the site make purchases, have their details on the profile page for speedier purchases, and have the ability to access a memberâ€™s page, on which they can view video clips and specific articles set up by banyan videos. Finally, members will have access to discounted prices on products they purchase|
|Customer(Anonymous) - level|An anonymous user, or a new user to the site will have the ability to browse the site and purchase products. However, it will not have the benefit of discounted prices, or access to the members area|

<hr>

**b. Scope**

- Therefore, the scope of the project will involve the following:

- The design and creation of a site to allow banyan videos corporation to post the video assets for purchase by the general public.

- The design will be of a clean and corporate style

- Initial data to support the site. (The Banyan Videos Corp may replace these to match their catalogue)


**Three specific users have been identified**

* Administrator 

* Registered user
* Anonymous user


**Scope Summary**

- The sites will offer discount prices to registered users

- The site will allow new customers membership sign-up

- The site will allow members to access a memberâ€™s section, where they will view members-only content

- Members will have the ability to complete a profile page to speed up future transactions.

- Video products on the site will be categorized by genre.

- Visitors to the site can search for products either by genre or by text on a search bar

- The site will be designed (** mobile-first **) and fluid, allowing it to adjust on mobile phones tablets and desktop computers.

- From technical aspects of meeting development speed, the site will be created user Django framework.

- The database will be the Postgres SQL relational database.

- The administrator will have access to the backend to update a "FILE" containing new products catalogue

- Initially, the site will be hosted on the "HEROKU platform". It is understood it may be re-hosted on some other platform in the future.

>**c. Structure**
 
**DATABASE MODELS**

* Django uses the concept of models to abstract data-content and data-structure from the "database type".

* This is fantastic, and it allows the developer to not worry about the specificity of databases. The developer can remain certain it will be easy to port the application to whatever database engine the client requires!

* A few database models were created to allow the Django website to function 

* A **'Foreign-Key'** is used between video films and video-film-genre, creating a relationship

Here is an ERP diagram. This shows the basic grouping and relationship of the various models and forms

* Green - product and product grouping, linked with a foreign Key
* Yellow - shopping/transaction grouping
* Blue - published content group  (general and members only )
* Red - Communications group content ( forms)

>**d. Skeleton**

I created mock-ups for the site pages. However, when they were built and tested, I was not comfortable with all of them. So, some were changed to their final incarnation. From that, I learnt that what looks good on paper does not always translate

**Colour Scheme**

The colour scheme I settled on is as follows. As directed, I tried to make it light and airy, clean and simple

|Colour Scheme|

|<img src="_support_docs/images/color-pallet-2of2.png" width="200">|

Aesthetics

The **Bootstrap** class was used for the buttons and forms, giving them a consistent rounded edge look.
The **Crispy Forms** module was use to beautify the forms within the various apps.

**Maintainable features by site admin**

As an administrator tasked with installing / maintaining the site. You can change features en-masse by accessing the server command line interface and then running these command processes.

* The 'add-banner' is a javascript file. simply open it up and type.

**Logged in as administrator:**

|Install Type|Action|
|------------|------|
|* After logging in to HEROKU| ----- HEROKU run python manage.py loaddata ---'server-file'|
|* Local install| python manage.py loaddata --- 'server-file'|

<hr>

**PAYMENT GATEWAY**

STRIPE is a payment solution which I have implemented on the site.
The benefit of using stripe is that I do not have to hold any of the users card payment details within the site. Stripe provides an abstraction layer which makes the site compliant with online and banking payment industries.

For development purposes all the payments are test and not real

https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/dashboard

<img src="_support_docs/images/stripe-payments.png" width="600">


<hr>

**Features Left to Implement**


* Most of the features expected have been implemented. However for the film models a field was left for global sales.The intention was to apply a discount to every item in Banyan Videos catalogue at once. My reasoning was for a flash sale.having the facility to make that happen would be a plus. However BVC has said that it is not necessary at present and it is under consideration. Therefore the model contains that option , but it will not be implemented presently.

* A backend Tool can be created to garner data from orphaned or incomplete purchase, as data is ket in the database during a shopping session, rather than kept in browser memory and lost. This can be exploited to get keener information on shopping habits, like facebook do with user activity.

* The  site has been tested on most of the popular browsers

|Browser|Version|Icon|
|-------|-------|----|
|Safari|Version 14.0 (15610.1.28.1.9, 15610)|<img src="_support_docs/images/safari-icon.png" width="50">|

|Firefox|83.0(64-bit)|<img src="_support_docs/images/firefox-icon.png" width="50">|

* Further testing was carried out, by using automated testing. Specifically an administrator can execute on the terminal command line **"python manage.py test"**. This command will execute Django unit testing **( setup inside  the home app 'test.py' )** and carry out a check on the accessible pages of the site.

**UI Changes**
* The original design thought I had, went with smaller fonts and sharper lines. However when I used the app on mobile devices such as Iphone & Ipad, it was difficult to navigate. And test users complained , frequently using the pinch option to magnify the screen. This was another step people had to perform. I therefore decided to modify the UI and make the buttons larger and the UI more simplistic. My concern was mobile-fist as opposed to desktop.

* The usual expectations in Mobile-First Design are there. 

* The navigation bar changes on smaller devices.
* The tables omit certain columns to fit better on small devices. ( in the purchase history e.g)

**Tested Physically on on:**

|Device|Type|
|------|----|
|Iphone 5| mobile|
|Iphone 7plus|mobile|
| Apple Mac| Desktop|

**Code validation**

* I implemented a 404 bad url catch-all more fore desktop users
* I implemented form empty content and  insufficient character check on contact form


**STRIPE PROCESSING**

As this site is a demo site. On the STRIPE payment panel..

<img src="_support_docs/images/stripe-payment-panel.png" width="400">

1. Enter your email
2. Enter 4242 4242 4242 4242
3. Date in the future - MM/YY
4. Enter any 3 digit - 123


**EMAIL RESET**

I decided to implement password change by simply asking the user to contact banyan videos, using the **contact form** 

<hr>

 
 
># <a id="deployment">6. Deployment</a>

[<< Back](#top)

* The deployment of the site can be done locally , it would then be really intranet based.

* Or, (more usual) on a web platform in a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), as most other internet sites.

<hr>

>## **Local Install**

<img src="_support_docs/images/django-local-stack-overview.png" width="600">

The Banyan-Videos-Corp website is a full stack website. A Django framework and Postgres
backed site. However for the local deployment. The deployment of the site will be in distinct stages

* Clone the Git-Hub Site

* Install "Git" on your local drive, an  ensure it is working

* From the Github * , copy the repo-download-link and paste to a local drive like this

<img src="_support_docs/images/git-clone-link.png" width="300">

**git clone <"copied link">  (return)**

Initialize Git

**git Initialize**

Git will create a clone of the Banyan-Videos-Corp site on your local drive.
At this stage you you have a copy of the site on your local computer.
However, we are not done.  The site was developed on a virtual environment( This abstracts the site from its surroundings, helping keep the integrity of all its support files). You will need to 

Initialize this virtual environment (venv) to launch the site locally

**source venv/bin/activate**

This will launch the virtual environment. You can confirm this because in the terminal session window
you will have venv in brackets at the beginning like so.

**(venv) mac1@mac1s-MacBook-Pro banyan-videos-corp-c**

Your terminal command line will vary but essential look similar

<img src="_support_docs/images/terminal-project-folder.png" width="600">

What you see is the structure of the Django site. The folders individual folders represent the project and Apps of the site, as Django philosophy states. Then there are some specific files that are important for the migration of the app to the HEROKU platform later...

**Folders**

|Folder|Type|Purpose|
|------|-------|-------|
|_banyanvideos_root|Django project|
|home|app|Homepage|
|about|app|about page of site|
|charge|app|works out the and submits to Stripe Payments Corp|
|Checkout|app|summary of the shopping cart value and presents table |
|contact|app|Contact form for customers to email inquiries|

|venv|virtual environment support| * |
|_support_docs|app| contains images that support this readme file ** can be deleted *|

<hr>

**Modules**

<img src="_support_docs/images/installed-packages.png" width="400">

<hr>

**IF YOU LAUNCH THE SITE AND NOTHING SHOWS FOLLOW THE PROCESS BELOW:**
* we need to create the database structures by using the Django models
- python manage.py makemigrations
- python manage.py migrate


* Finally we need to upload the initial data to populate the models

- python manage.py loaddata **< * JSON FILES>**


|*JSON File|Purpose|
|---------|-------|
|genre|create the genre for the films|
|films|The film product items|
|article|The articles for the sites front page|
|frontpagecarousel| The selected images for the frontpage carousel|
|snippet|News snippets and stuff for members area|


**IN THE TERMINAL WINDOW CREATE A SUPER USER ACCOUNT FOR THE SITE**

* python manage.py createsuperuser , and follow the prompts

* This is carried out on a new database, as it will not have any information. 
* Keep the details secure and safe, as this is the **MASTER account** that will get you into the backend(server-side) of the Django application!

<hr>


To launch the site type

**python3 manage.py runserver  (enter)**


The home page will launch if you open a local browser to 
**http:127.0.0.1:8000** which is a localhost address


<img src="_support_docs/images/banyan-videos-corp-home-page.jpg" width="400">


**Local Environment Variables**

To run, the software depends on some environment variables, which are kept on the server side. 
The user will not have access to these

* These variables are set up by the server/system admin during software install

* The software will use the **Python-dot-env** Module to load these variables into service on the local platform

>## **HEROKU Install**

<img src="_support_docs/images/bd-heroku-install-overview.png" width="600">

The local install works for two reasons
* Django has included by default a database sql-lite-3
* Django has a WSGI compatible http server inbuilt to its suite

Running the Django app on any platform other than a local setup requires a bit more consideration.
You need to ensure that you hosting platform has 

* A web-server that supports **WSGI** 
* A platform that will run python 
* A database supporting SQL.. ( for this site I have chosen **POSTGRES** as mentioned in the strategy spec )
* The ability to serve 'STATIC' files**

The **"HEROKU"** platform supports the first two elements, however the fourth ('STATIC' file serving ) requires the installation of a module called 'Whitenoise' to achieve it. You will see whitenoise version 5.2.0 in the pip installed modules list


##**Process:**##

**Ensure you have completed the local install!**


* Sign up to **HEROKU.com**, and attain an account
* Create a HEROKU app - "banyan-videos-corp-c"
* Attach a Postgres-db resource

<img src="_support_docs/images/heroku-postgress-db.png" width="400">


**ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**

* Environment variables are important and are the missing link to make things operate. They are mainly used to hold some arbitrary value which we do not necessarily wish to disclose in hard-format where users can get access. Because environment variables are controlled by the sysadmin, any user other than a sysadmin will not have access to the. For this reason we keep the secret keys and other credentials we wish to remain secure.

* In the local install the environment variables are kept in the **.env file**, and are loaded on Django launch by the module **'python_dotenv'**. However on the HEROKU platform it is manually entered under the 'settings tab'

* Next setup the HEROKU environment variables under the settings tab - ( reveal config vars)

<img src="_support_docs/images/heroku-env-vars.png" width="300">

* The environment variables are what the sysadmin would configure in the background on a hosted server, and would not be available to the user through a http serve. Therefore it is secure.

* The important environment variables are highlighted with the red arrow.

|Environment Variable|Purpose|
|--------------------|-------|
|DATABASE_URL|The url pointing to the HEROKU Postgres database instance|
|DBKEY|The key for the database to log it in|
|DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC| Stops HEROKU running a collect static files on compile|
|PRODUCTION| * This variable is used to direct the source database from sql-lite3(internal) or  HEROKU Postgres|
|SECRET_KEY|Security key required for the Django app to launch|
|STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY| Provided by stripe.com for transactions|
|STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY|Provided by stripe.com for transactions|
|FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHHOLD|40.00 (Value can be changed)|

* It's important to  mention that **the Django application like most will depend on the database**. after all all web-servers simply serve data.

* Therefore while developing it is possible to not worry so much and use the integrated sql-lite3 database. However that will not usually be possible on a foreign hosting platform. This is the reason **I chose "POSTGRES" database , an SQL - compatible RDMBS that is available on the HEROKU platform**.

* I use the **"PRODUCTION"** environment variable to tell the APPLICATION upon launch to use either the integrated SQL-Lite3 database or the HEROKU external( to Django Application ) database using the code below in the settings.py

<img src="_support_docs/images/database-switcher.png" width="400">


Within the file-structure of the local repo, there are two important files

* requirements.txt
* Procfile

* HEROKU uses the **contents of these two files to provision the application on HEROKU**. The format tells HEROKU which modules to install and the latter essentially tells HEROKU to provision a webserver WSGI compatible

<img src="_support_docs/images/folders.png" width="200">


* Now follow the HEROKU guide and **"use git to upload the local repo to HEROKU"**

* we need to create the database structures by using the Django models
- HEROKU run python manage.py makemigrations
- HEROKU run python manage.py migrate


* Finally we need to upload the initial data to populate the models

- HEROKU run python manage.py loaddata **< * JSON FILES>**

**Json Files**

|*JSON File|Purpose|
|---------|-------|
|genre|create the genre for the films|
|films|The film product items|
|article|The articles for the sites front page|
|frontpagecarousel| The selected images for the front page carousel|
|snippet|News snippets and stuff for members area|


**IN THE TERMINAL WINDOW CREATE A SUPER USER ACCOUNT FOR THE SITE**

* python manage.py createsuperuser , and follow the prompts

* This is carried out on a new database, as it will not have any information. 
* Keep the details secure and safe, as this is the **MASTER account** that will get you into the backend(server-side) of the Django application!




Finally if you send your browser to :

* Your app can be found at **https://banyan-videos-corp-c.herokuapp.com/**

You should see your site.

>**WARNING:**
* The site settings promote the view of the site from any host. It is possible in production that you may wish a limited range of access. The ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*'] settings should be modified and made more specific in that instance.

* DEBUG = False  should be left as is in Production 

* DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=0 should be left as 0 in PRODUCTION, allowing static files to be collected and compiled to the project 'static' folder during boot-up, otherwise you may receive a internal '500 server error'

* **HouseKeeping**
There are times when users would peruse the site and add items to the basket. They may then leave the system or
shut down the browser. This cause orphaned product cart entries. There is no real way to stop this. However because the entries are dated the site-admin can log into the CMS and delete items that a a few days older than the present from the shopping-cart model.

* It is worth a mention that all data is useful, and I could in a future release, write a too that can extract these orphans, and this would yield important data as to products that the customer are seeking. The orphan may be because they have found a cheaper supplier. However we do know that the product was at once of interest. If the username is not anonymous , a script can be written to mail that username in the future an advert regarding that same product.

Therefore this would be something to bring to BVC as a future enhancement.

The software is reliant on external systems beyond my control.

* Email system. Mailing providers have limits to external mail

* External images sources

It is possible that these systems can temporarily fail. Under real operations , these systems will be monitored and addressed. However because this is a demo, and It will be locked for marking, I have little control once project is submitted.
